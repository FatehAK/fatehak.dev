A compilation of various `git` commands as I went on with my daily development work are listed here. I plan to keep this page updated as I explore more.

- **Clone with submodules**: `git clone --recurse-submodules [repo]{:bash}`

- **Clone a single branch**: `git clone --single-branch -b [branch name] [repo]{:shell}`

- **Add or update submodules to an already cloned project**:
  - `git submodule update --init --recursive{:shell}` (add)
  - `git submodule update --recursive --remote{:shell}` (update)

- **Delete local branches non-existent on remote**: `git branch -vv | grep 'origin/.*: gone]' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs git branch -d{:shell}`

- **Rebase a `feature` branch onto `main`**:
  1. Check out and pull both branches.
  2. `git checkout main && git pull{:shell}`
  3. `git rebase [feat_branch]{:shell}`
  4. Also, rebase with origin if needed `git rebase origin/main{:shell}`
  5. Resolve conflicts if any and do `git add .{:shell}`
  6. `git rebase --continue{:shell}`

- **Cherry pick**:

  1. Pull both branches and checkout `main`.
  2. Gather `SHA`'s of commits you'd like to pick from your `feat` branch.
  3. Do `git cherry-pick [COMMIT_SHA]{:shell}` (note: `COMMIT_SHA` should be taken in the oldest first order)
  4. Resolve conflicts if any and do `git add .{:shell}`
  5. `git cherry-pick --continue{:shell}`

- **Revert a commit**:
  - `git revert HEAD{:shell}` (will revert the topmost commit)
  - `git revert [SHA]{:shell}`

- **Push a new branch to remote**: `git push --set-upstream origin [local_branch]{:shell}`

- **Reset a file in local**: `git checkout HEAD -- [path to file]{:shell}`

- **Check which git tag has a given commit**: `git tag --contains [SHA]{:shell}`

- **Create a patch from changes**:
  - `git diff > [patch_name.patch]{:shell}` for unstaged changes.
  - `git diff --cached [patch_name.patch]{:shell}` for staged changes.
  - `git diff HEAD [patch_name.patch]{:shell}` for both staged and unstaged changes.

- **Create a patch from commit**: `git format-patch -1 HEAD{:shell}` (-1 signifies one commit to be added in patch)

- **Apply a local patch**: `git apply [patch_path]{:shell}`

- **Apply a patch from commit**: `git am -3 < file.patch{:shell}`

- **Stash only unstaged changes**: `git stash -k{:shell}`
