I've just created my first NPM package and was scouring the web for ways to automate the process of publishing it.

Here were my requirements:

- A single command from start to end.
- Every release should follow [semver](https://semver.org/) with automatic creation of git tags.
- Simple way to choose the type of release. (major / minor / patch)
- Auto generation of release notes based on commit history.
- Possibility to draft a release on GitHub. (nice to have)

As I was searching for tools that could accomplish the above, I came across [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) which satisfied all of my requirements with the the right amount of flexibility.

## Demo

Here is a short demo of me publishing a package using [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it):

<Video src={demoVideo}>Publishing my package <a href="https://github.com/FatehAK/genzo-cli">genzo</a> to NPM</Video>

A GitHub release is created with the `draft` status and also the changelog and assets are prefilled and uploaded already without any manual intervention.

The whole process only took around a minute else we would have to type in various commands in sequence for bumping the version, generating a git tag, creating a tarball, writing a changelog and finally publishing the package to NPM.

All of these steps are automated by [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) and every aspect of it is customizable as well with a configuration file.

## Installation

```shell
npm install -D release-it
```

After installation, add release-it to the `scripts` section in your `package.json` file.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "release": "release-it"
  },
}
```

Now create a `.release-it.js` file in your project's `root` directory. We will use this to configure it.

## Usage

Once your package is ready to be published, run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
npm run release
```

You will be shown the changelog first and then followed by a series of prompts with the option to choose the type of release (major / minor / patch).

> ;info;
> By default release-it will bump the `version` key in `package.json`. So, if the package is being published for the first time make sure its initially set to `0.0.0`.

Here is the configuration I used to publish the package as shown in the demo:

```js title=".release-it.js"
module.exports = {
  git: {
    commitMessage: 'chore: Release v${version}',
    tagName: 'v${version}',
    requireCommits: true, // require commits since last tag
    requireCleanWorkingDir: true, // exits if local not upto date with remote or if workdir is unclean
  },
  github: {
    release: true, // creates a github release
    draft: true, // github releases are only drafted, confirm the draft in github releases page to publish it
    releaseName: 'âœ¨ v${version}',
    commitArgs: ['-S'], // creates gpg signed commits
    tagArgs: ['-s'], // creates gpg signed tags
    assets: ['tar/*.tgz'], // assets to be included in the GitHub releases page
  },
  npm: {
    publish: true,
  },
  hooks: {
    // runs lint before publishing
    'before:init': ['pnpm lint'],
    // build the package to publish and the generate a tarball for use in github releases
    'after:bump': 'pnpm build && pnpm tarball',
    'after:release': 'echo Successfully created a release v${version} for ${repo.repository}.',
  },
};
```

The added support for lifecycle `hooks` is my favorite feature as it allows us to run tasks at various stages of publishing. (eg. you could run your `lint` and `test` jobs before we begin the release process saving us time if they were to fail later)

You can refer its [documentation](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#release-it-) to learn more about the configuration.

That's all folks!

I loved the intuitive prompt based approach offered by [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) as it helps reduce the friction involved in package publishing.

Hope this post motivated you to streamline your package release process!
