In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a [hobbit-hole][1], and that means comfort.

Some of these words <ins>will be underlined</ins>.

Hi, I love emojis a lot :zap:

I need to highlight these ==very important words==.

~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.

Here's a simple footnote[^boo], and here's a longer one[^foo]

## Lists

* First nested list item
* Second nested list item

## Image

<Figure alt="Mouse events to mock Swipe" src={image2}>
  Mouse events to mock <code>Swipe</code>
</Figure>

## JS

```js {4} showLineNumbers title="appConfig.js"
const navContainer = document.querySelector('#nav-container');
const readingProgressMobile = document.querySelector('#reading-progress');

let lastScrollY = document.documentElement.scrollTop;
const isScrollProgressVisible = readingProgressMobile.dataset.reading === 'true';

window.addEventListener(
  'scroll',
  function () {
    function checkScroll() {
      const st = document.documentElement.scrollTop;
      const scrollHeight = document.documentElement.scrollHeight;
      const clientHeight = document.documentElement.clientHeight;
    }

    checkScroll();
    window.requestAnimationFrame(checkScroll);
  },
  { capture: true, passive: true }
);
```

This is <mark>Foo</mark>

[^boo]: This is the first footnote.

[^foo]: This is the second footnote.
