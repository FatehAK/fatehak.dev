After working on my personal portfolio with Gatsby, I took some time to transition my project to Typescript. It was the perfect opportunity to learn how to use it as I have never worked with it in the past. A breadcrumbs component shows where in the site hierarchy the user is. The name is from Hansel and Gretel, who dropped breadcrumbs behind them in some dark woods and were able to find their way home by tracing crumbs backwards.

The breadcrumbs in this post are not standard breadcrumbs, they're breadcrumb-like. They offer additional functionality by putting sibling pages right into the navigation with a, making multi-tiered access possible.

Learning about how to write Typescript types and how to use it wasn’t much of a problem as I’m used to working with Flow. However, it was the whole set up of tslint, remembering to install type definitions and simply writing custom type definitions that were new to me and not as easy as I would have expected. This is why I thought this would deserve a little article containing an up to date guide explaining how to set up all these tools and get them to run properly on an existing project.

### Background UX

Often, it’s not possible to illustrate the problem with a REPL. Here’s what you do:

1. Create a sample repo on GitHub or Stackblitz (or wherever)
2. Demonstrate the problem, and nothing but the problem. Whittle it down to the bare minimum of code that reliably demonstrates the issue.
3. Get rid of any dependencies that aren’t directly related to the problem.
4. Install all your dependencies to package.json. If the maintainer can’t clone the repo and do npm install && npm run build (or similar – see point 4) to see the problem, because the maintainer needs some globally installed CLI tool or whatever, that would make it harder to get to the bottom of the issue.
5. Include instructions in the repo, along with a description of the expected and actual behaviour. Obviously the issue should include information about the bug as well, but it’s really helpful if README.md includes that information, plus a link back to the issue. If there are any instructions beyond npm install && npm run build, they should go here.

In the component demo video above, the placeholder categories are genres of video games. This trail is created by navigating the following path: `home » rpg » indie » on sale`, as shown below.

## Great `architecture`

I find it's helpful to think in terms of collections and items.

## Layouts

### Markup

Good components begin with appropriate HTML. In this next section I'll cover my markup choices and how they impact the overall component.

#### Dark and `light` scheme
```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light">
```

### Styles
Since the color uses system colors, it's mostly gaps and stacks for styles!
