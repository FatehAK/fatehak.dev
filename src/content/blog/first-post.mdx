After working on my personal portfolio with Gatsby, I took some time to transition my project to Typescript. It was the perfect opportunity to learn how to use it as I have never worked with it in the past. A breadcrumbs component shows where in the site hierarchy the user is. The name is from Hansel and Gretel, who dropped breadcrumbs behind them in some dark woods and were able to find their way home by tracing crumbs backwards.

The breadcrumbs in this post are not standard breadcrumbs, they're breadcrumb-like. They offer additional functionality by putting sibling pages right into the navigation with a, making multi-tiered access possible.

Learning about how to write Typescript types and how to use it wasn’t much of a problem as I’m used to working with Flow. However, it was the whole set up of tslint, remembering to install type definitions and simply writing custom type definitions that were new to me and not as easy as I would have expected. This is why I thought this would deserve a little article containing an up to date guide explaining how to set up all these tools and get them to run properly on an existing project.

### Background UX

In the component demo video above, the placeholder categories are genres of video games. This trail is created by navigating the following path: `home » rpg » indie » on sale`, as shown below.

## Information architecture

I find it's helpful to think in terms of collections and items.

## Layouts

### Markup

Good components begin with appropriate HTML. In this next section I'll cover my markup choices and how they impact the overall component.
